ðŸ“Š **Toronto Hydro Utility Performance Analysis**
This project, completed as part of my Enterprise Analytics course, analyzed historical electricity utility data to support Toronto Hydro in improving key performance metrics related to customer service, operational efficiency, and safety.

I used historical datasets from the Ontario Energy Board and applied Business Intelligence (BI) and data visualization techniques to identify underperforming KPIs and set SMART objectives for internal teams at Toronto Hydro.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Findings & Recommendations
Target Area	Objective
ðŸ“ž Telephone Call Handling	Increase calls answered on time to 85% within 1 year
âš¡ Power Outage Reduction	Cut average outage hours per customer by 10%
ðŸ’¸ Cost Control	Reduce average cost per customer by 15% over 3 years
ðŸ’¼ Profitability Alignment	Reach 100% of the regulated profitability benchmark in 2 years
ðŸš“ Public Safety	Halve public incidents over 2 years

Strategic Recommendations
To help Toronto Hydro meet its performance improvement goals, we developed the following strategic initiatives based on data-driven insights and industry best practices:

ðŸ“ž Optimize Call Center Operations
Implement advanced call-routing systems and self-service options such as IVRs and chatbots. Increase staffing during peak hours and provide targeted customer service training. These improvements aim to raise the percentage of calls answered on time to 85% within one year.

âš¡ Invest in Smart Grid Technologies
Deploy smart grid solutions including automated fault detection, real-time performance monitoring, and outage management systems. Prioritize the upgrade of aging infrastructure in high-outage zones to reduce outage hours per customer by 10%.

ðŸ’¸ Enhance Cost Management
Streamline procurement and inventory systems, adopt energy-efficient and renewable technologies, and conduct operational audits to identify and eliminate inefficiencies. These measures are projected to reduce average cost per customer by 15% over three years.

ðŸ’¼ Strengthen Financial Management Practices
Align operations with regulated profitability benchmarks through robust financial modeling, performance-linked accountability frameworks, and exploration of diversified revenue streams (e.g., demand response programs). This will help achieve 100% of the benchmark profitability target within two years.

ðŸš“ Implement Public Safety Programs
Roll out proactive public safety campaigns, upgrade safety-related infrastructure, and establish rapid-response units for emergencies and outages. These efforts are designed to halve general public incidents within two years.
